                <li>Site map: one big page, my name at the top</li>
                <li>Gray and white</li>
                <li>Smaller tabs underneath - each leading to a different page: about me, my work, interests, contact, past employment</li>
                <li>About me: most of the content from WA2,</li>
                <li>My work: displaying and explaining some relevant work that I've done </li>
                <li>Contact: emails, phone</li>
                <li>Employment: essentially a resume</li>
                <li>Keep it light and airy while being serious and professional - but not totally boring, maybe working some aspects of the work I display into the designs on other pages - faded picture being the background
                    Some photos and stuff located under the main points as you scroll</li>
