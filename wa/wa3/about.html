    <section class="about">
        <p>My name is Rebecca Kohler, but most people call me Becca. I am from Bedford Massachusetts, a small town outside
        Boston. I have two younger sisters back home - one of which is a high school senior and applying to CU! I grew up
        skiing, and have always loved being outdoors. I like watching movies and TV shows while cook, and hanging out with
        friends.</p>

        <h3>My Interests</h3>
        <p>I am currently learning more about cooking, as I have cooked a little bit in my childhood, and am now fully cooking
        for myself. I am passionate about sailing, childhood development, and my family.</p>
