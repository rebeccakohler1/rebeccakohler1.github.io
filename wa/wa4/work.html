    <p>I am a sophomore undergrad at the University of Colorado Boulder, studying Creative Technology and Design. </p>
    <p>I took four years of ceramics class through highschool, and in doing so, found a great hobby and interest that I have continued to love through the years. 
        I am a very creative person, and always have been. I am a people person and want to pursue a career path allowing me to work closely with others and implement design in my work. Some work that I have completed that 
        I feel represent me and my vision are shown below.</p>
